# Risk Register – GRC Project

This project presents a sample risk register tailored for a banking environment. It evaluates potential operational and cybersecurity risks based on likelihood, severity, and priority using a risk matrix model.

## 📘 Project Overview

The register analyzes threats such as:
- Business email compromise (BEC)
- Data encryption vulnerabilities
- Exposure of backup databases
- Physical theft
- Natural disaster impacts on supply chains

It includes qualitative scoring and risk prioritization logic for effective governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) assessment.
